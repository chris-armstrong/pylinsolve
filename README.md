# pylinsolve - Solving systems of linear equations
The purpose of this tool is to aid in expressing and solving
sets of linear equations using Python.

This tool will take a textual description of the equations,
convert this into matrix form, and then run the solver
iteratively until it converges to a solution.

pylinsolve uses Gauss-Seidel/SOR to iterate to a solution.  
It also uses parts of sympy to aid in parsing the equations.

The initial motivation for this tool was to solve economic
models based on Stock Flow Consistent (SFC) models.
